## INTREPID III

Intrepid is a 5-year research programme funded by the UKRI Medical Research Council (2023-2028) that investigates the epidemiology of psychotic disorders in several countries in the Global South, including India, Nigeria, and Trinidad.

This work builds upon and expands one of the most comprehensive research programmes ever conducted on psychoses across multiple countries in the Global South.

For now, this is being built in [Amadeus 7](https://intrepid.amadeusweb.site/home/~class~btnNBSPbtn-primary~/class~).
