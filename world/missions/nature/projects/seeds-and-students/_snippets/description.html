	<blockquote><p>Especially the urban dwellers, regardless of their social and economic background, should receive the necessary intervention to become climate resilient and also adapt the effects of Climate change in their everyday life. Due to a rising demand for such intervention, we plan to expand our reach from June 2025.<br />`Radhakrishnan S`</p></blockquote>

	<h3>Statement of Need</h3>

	<p>Children are the most vulnerable to Climate crisis. Children born today will live through
	more decades of climate instability than adults alive now. This means they will face greater
	cumulative risks from rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and resource scarcity.
	Children contribute least to the crisis but suffer the most.</p>

	<p>To make them climate resilient, we plan to reach 2000 students in the upcoming academic
	year (2025-26) in Chennai. Introducing them to kitchen garden at their homes will improve
	quality and nutritious food access. And also provides the children a much needed emotional
	support by connecting with soil and plants. However, this intervention requires financial
	assistance to sustain and improve the quality of work.</p>
