In this section, we will describe key collaborators needed for a new kind of `#SocialEngineering`.

## Some Background

I am Imran Ali Namazi, IT Solution Architect with 20 years of coding experience, writer with over 500 poems published and a fervent dreamer for a brighter future for us all.

I've evolved a system for building websites that is, in my opinion, more manageable and aligned to long term content additions and updates. It is the AmadeusWeb.com Builder version 8.

I'm currently working on a full rewrite of it as part of an AmadeusWeb.world led network release due in August 2025.

Considering this the launch of a new age of an “Internet of Missions,” kindly treat this as a personal invitation from me, Imran, for YOU to discuss becoming a potential member.

Or please share this with another kindred soul who espouses the cause of humanity. I will share the plans for community engagement in a follow-on video.

## Under the Hood

Everything is in a file - yes, this means readable text files that can be backed up using the same system we developers use for code namely Git.

This enables:

* Flexibility on how we organise content.
* Extensive changes to be made offline, reviewed and uploaded (over FTP).
* Backup and content traceability - built in.
* Developer assisted frontend coding for styling etc (cleaner than what rich text editors produce).
* An elegant, minimalistic, open-to-extension backend already aligned to progressive approaches like html-first.com

## Why is this Important?

* Information often times gets fragmented.
* Social media platforms don't let us “own our content”.
* Conversations with a website visitor / student / community member rarely makes its way back to the website.
* Search engines are starting to factor in “messy frontend code”

## What [AmadeusWeb Builder](%core-url%) can do

* Plan pages for summaries of chapters and subchapters. Or articles on topics. Structured with “deep dive” material like summary, takeaway, things to ponder and activities which the reader / student can reply to in good time.
* Once a "conversation" (composed by us, but initiated BY the user from their accounts) is complete, it can be decided whether to upload it as part of the “discuss” section of the page - like Wikipedia has a talk tab.
* Include social media links to the page so everyone can feel free to share online, then have those threads available in the originating page.
* Work on presentations - uses slides.com - so this too is  text based and can be tracked.
* Build in levels of content based on the reader. And anytime, accessible detail (which we suggest putting out via Google drive) can be made into links.
* Unlike other platforms, you would own the content and all its developments from day 1.

## In Closing

The idea of the network is to allow multiple organisations to work in unison towards their stated purposes, but in a concerted single place. Even on the network, any section or subsection can still be “owned by you” and moved later to an independent site.

I've some more ideas on how students can have full fledged websites on their own, and be given a badge to represent you in their neighbourhoods. More on this later.

Warmly,
