slide	Intro
sub-heading	Welcome to AmadeusWeb<hr />

item	[So] that tech may actually help<br />us TOWARDS a Life Divine.

slide	Who
sub-heading	Imran Ali Namazi
item	IT Solution Architect, Poet & [Dreamer](#todo-new-imran-ym-links).
item	Wants to [one day](#todo-india-by-sa-1947) inspire positive change .
item	Says let's work towards and become one day a society simply [teeming with life](https://imran.yieldmore.org/teeming-with-life).

slide	What
sub-heading	AmadeusWeb Builder <span class="lowercase">v</span>8
item	A new [Web4](#todo-web4-whitepaper) paradigm for long-term content development.
item	August 2025 will mark a new age of an [Internet of Missions](%url%some-concepts/#todo-highlight=iom).
item	Let's compare notes - pain points and paradigm shifts - and why :)

slide	How
sub-heading	How AmadeusWeb Works
item	A simple yet powerful folder / file structure, backed by the ubiquitous Git.
item	Content becomes "managed" - allowing for better synergies.
item	Offline edits can be reviewed beforehand and code impact tested too.

slide	Advantages
sub-heading	Key Advantages of the System
item	Traceability for [every change/addition](#todo-gci-changes-history) gives visibility **unheard** of in other systems.
item	[Developer Assistance / Mindset](%url%some-concepts/#todo-highlight=) makes WYSIWYG (rich text) editor's output cleaner.
item	Search Engines respect clean and structured output implicit in [our Tech DNA](#todo-concept).

slide	Disadvantages
sub-heading	The "price" of the pains
item	Orientation, Training and Customization needed because of it's peculiar intricacies.
item	No [plugin](#todo-spanda-stability-case-study) marketplace, [proprietary](%url%some-concepts/#highlight=no-forking), though [suggestions](#todo-term-architectural-spirit) welcome.
item	No Login implies NO "hacking threat" - we use our own [Smart Site Uploader](https://v7.amadeusweb.com/tools/) since 2007.

slide	Audience
sub-heading	NOT for you? Thats OK
item	We are for those [progressive movements](%url%collaborations/with-lightworkers/), ready to take a leap of faith.
item	We are not an eCom platform or the right tool for Digital Agencies to "switch to."
item	Our pooled resources will help individuals learn the skills & sensibilities to **aid in that mission**.

slide	Big Corp
sub-heading	Deliberately Fragmented
paragraph	Let's face it - engineering systems are mostly architected by Large Corporations with their own motives. And the rest of the industry just follows.<hr />
paragraph	Data Ownership?? In Social Media?? - Posts, Comments, Videos, Reels, AI Recorded Meeting Minutes etc means that some "[big corp](#todo)" has you!

slide	Content is YOURS
sub-heading	Digital Democracy
item	Websites rarely reflect [dialogue](#todo-drupal-and-fb-hack-case-study) nor have the transparency / verifiability of Git.
item	With us, content is YOURS from Day 1. Web First before social media also means a public verifiable record via Git - much easier than current Web3 approaches.

slide	Verifiability
sub-heading	Transitioning to **Game B**
paragraph	This is a battle, a war, and the casualties could be your hearts and souls ~ [John Keating](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/quotes/?item=qt0437471).
item	Netizens use **The Wayback Machine** when tampering happens, but that's painstaking.
item	We suggest public Git repositories for public websites.

slide	Embellishing Content
sub-heading	A Tapestry of <abbr title="TODO: make demoable">Interaction</abbr>
item	Structured page planning, "prompts" for <abbr title="email / whatsapp &mdash; sans automation">offline interaction</abbr> is only the beginning.
item	In-page record of replies, developments, etc makes for a well coordinated overview.
item	Social media cross-referencing added to this strengthens community engagement.

slide	Our True Power
sub-heading	Imaginative Communities
item	We [envision a network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6JoVisHn7g) where multiple organizations collaborate towards mutual goals while retaining ownership of their individual spaces.
item	The design supports a cohesive yet diverse community, around a [nexus of 3 websites](#%imran-url%/todo) that will form a Web4 pilot, that should take shape by early 2026.

slide	The Next Generation
sub-heading	Opportunities for All
item	Neighborhoods, Custodians and Skills - all linked by "close knit teams".
item	Humble individuals, small changes - one act of kindness at a time.
paragraph	<hr /><div style="text-align: center;">More on this soon</div>
